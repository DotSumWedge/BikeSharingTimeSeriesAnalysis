# The chosen data set is the bike_sharing_dataset.csv from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juliajemals/bike-sharing-washington-dc
# The chosen response variable is total_cust
# Being able to model and predict total_cust can help entities directly involved or adjacent to bike sharing better understand and predict the varying demand to avoid oversupply or shortages. Forecasting future demand can help plan bike maintance as heavily used bikes break down more often. This information can help inform business decisions, setting prices, and creating efective advertisements.

# The realization plot shows strong periodic trends, wandering behavior, and variance that changes over time.

# We see slowly dampening autocorrelation with weak and an irregular length periodic behavior.

# There is a peak at zero in the parzen frequency window.
# The parzen window also shows a peak around 0.15, which is a period of 1/0.15 = 6.666. 
#   B/c this data is collected daily, there evidence to suggest a weekly trend.
#   We can hypothesize total_cust could have a greater total_cust on the weekends when all other variables are held constant.
